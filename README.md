# explore_app

Mobile App with 2 Screens to display a list of countries and their details when tapped on it.

## Code Base.
The code base is split into 4 groups.
- The UI
- The data model
- The network parameters
- The homepage

The UI has 2 screens, one for the Country List with filter and search functionalities
The first screen displays the  countries in a list and allows you to select. On selection, it takes you to screen 2 which shows the Details of the country
Major widgets used are a ListView builder and A List Tile.


The data model was gotten from the RestAPI which breaks down the information into classes, constructors, methods and variables using JSON serialization
Packages used include the http package, a country list package was tested as well but didn't work

## Challenges.
Getting the data model was a tough task untill i learnt of a model generatorðŸ˜¢
Sorting through the dart files created to allow reusable widgets and classes became a hassle.
Null safety was a huge problem and had to go through different documentations to at least understand itðŸ˜­
Still unable to complete the task as my code became a messðŸ˜£

## Features.
None available at the moment. Haven't been able to complete the task
